# docker

container technology: a tool for creating and managing containers

container: standardized unit of software. A package of code and dependencies to run that code (eg NodeJS code + NodeJS runtime)

this is part of cloud computing services:

IaaS (infrastructure as a service)
  - data center physical plant 
  - networking firewalls / security 
  - servers and storage

PaaS (platform as a service)
  - operating system
  - development tools, database management, business analytics

SaaS (software as a service)
  - Hosted applications

the same container yields the exact same behavior and application (compare it with a picnic)

docker simplifies the creation of containers and management
