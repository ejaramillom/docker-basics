# deployment object

- we define a controller
- here, we set a desired state and then kubernetes changes the actual state
- it also defines which pods and containers to run and the number of instances
- we can also pause, delete and roll back deployments
- there is also scaling, we can do auto scaling, dynamic scaling and more
- we can change the number of desired pods as needed
- we need to use deployments to set up the desired state
