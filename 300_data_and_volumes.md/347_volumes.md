# volumes

- are folders on your host machine hard drive, mounted (made available or mapped) into containers
- they are mapped from docker to the machine and viceversa
- changes in one folder will be accessible in the other folder (changes in the machine are reflected in the container) and so on
- volumes persist when a container is shut down
- volume is not removed when container is removed
