# aws services

- ec2 are virtual servers in the cloud
- go to `launch instance`
- choose `amazon linux 2 AMI (HVM)`
- `next - configure instance`
- select a `vpc` for security issues with the instance
- then choose `launch`
- here we can create a new key pair using `SSH` and run commands in it
- key pair name `example-one`
- if we loose the key, we have to shut down the instance and create a new one
- then in the AWS console you should have the instances

## ssh connection to remote servers

in linux it comes with default, in windows it is needed to use WVM, or PuTTY as well.

- in the instance page of AWS we do `connection method - a standalone SSH connection`
- `chmod 400 example-1.pem` # it gives permissions to the file for read write
- then we copy the command `ssh -i 'example-1.pem' ec2-.....name-of-the-instance`
- after that we will be connected in the remote machine `[ec2-user@ip-172-2-20-0]`
- in this virtual machine we need to install docker and all the dependencies to be able to run the project

## installing dependencies in an AWS instance

Please note that the following command (which is used in the next lecture) will unfortunately not work anymore:

`amazon-linux-extras install docker`

Instead, use this approach / these commands:

```
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum -y install docker
 
sudo service docker start
 
sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user
```

Make sure to log out + back in after running these commands.

Once you logged back in, run this command:

`sudo systemctl enable docker`

Thereafter, you can check whether Docker is available by running:

`docker version`
