# containers

often the production environments: runtimes, languages, frameworks are different from development

eg:

in developed an app with nodejs v14

when using 'await' syntax in nodejs v12 in production (cloud or server machine), the app wont work

- Different development & production environments
- Different local development environments (team / company)
- clashing tools / versions between projects
