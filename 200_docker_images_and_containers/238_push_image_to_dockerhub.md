# docker hub

- official docker image registry
- public, private and official images from developer teams (node, ruby, python etc)

# private registry

- any provider or registry you want to use
- only your own or team images

## share

- `docker push thing_name`
- `docker pull thing_name`
- we should name our local image with the name we put in dockerhub or in the private registry
- we have to do `docker login` (it also exist `docker logout`)
